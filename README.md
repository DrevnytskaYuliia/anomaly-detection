##  AI-Assisted Financial Anomaly Detection

###  Project Overview  

HI! I’m building a tool to make financial review smarter and easier.
It takes quarterly and annual financial statements (Balance Sheets, P&L, Cash Flow) and runs them through a mix of rules and machine learning.

The goal:
- Spot numbers that don’t look right (big jumps, unusual ratios, mismatches).
- Give myself (or an accountant) a heads-up before these issues slip through a year-end closing.
- Add short, plain-language explanations so it’s clear why something looks odd.
  
Everything runs locally and securely (no data leaves my system), so it stays GDPR-friendly.
